# osm-data-exploration

## My BSc thesis at the University of Gy≈ër

The notebooks may (and most probably will) take too long to render on GitHub, it's easier to see them in action through NBViewer:
1. [Visualizing COVID-19 data from March 2020 - April 2022](https://nbviewer.org/github/szucshey/osm-data-exploration/blob/main/covid/covid-data-visualization.ipynb?flush_cache=true)
2. [Visualizing data from censuses in Hungary (currently work in progress)](https://nbviewer.org/github/szucshey/osm-data-exploration/blob/main/census/census_data_in_hungary.ipynb?flush_cache=true)


A detailed description is yet to be added.
