# osm-data-exploration

## My BSc thesis at the University of Gy≈ër

The notebooks may (and most probably will) take too long to render on GitHub, it's easier to see them in action through NBViewer, or see their output in some other rendered format:
1. [Visualizing COVID-19 data from March 2020 - April 2022](https://nbviewer.org/github/szucshey/osm-data-exploration/blob/main/covid/covid-data-visualization.ipynb?flush_cache=true) [Jupyter notebook]
2. [Visualizing data from censuses in Hungary](https://github.com/szucshey/osm-data-exploration/blob/main/census/census-2011.gif) [GIF]
3. [Displaying earthquakes in Europe from 2010-2022](https://nbviewer.org/github/szucshey/osm-data-exploration/blob/main/earthquakes/earthquakes.ipynb?flush_cache=true) [Jupyter notebook]


Detailed descriptions about each topic are in each subfolder's README. (TBA)
