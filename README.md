# osm-data-exploration

## My BSc thesis at the University of Gy≈ër

The main goal of the thesis is to discover and demonstrate the capabilities of different mapping libraries, using OpenStreetMap as a base service.
I've selected 5 different topics that I wanted to visualize on maps. The data sources for each topic were looked up from free sources on the internet, and were either downloaded by the provided ways, scraped (if there was no other way), or collected manually.

The notebooks may take too long to render on GitHub, it's easier to see them in action through NBViewer, or see their output in some other rendered format:
1. [Visualizing COVID-19 data in Hungary from March 2020 - April 2022](https://nbviewer.org/github/szucshey/osm-data-exploration/blob/main/covid/covid-data-visualization.ipynb?flush_cache=true) [NBViewer]
2. [Visualizing data from censuses in Hungary](https://github.com/szucshey/osm-data-exploration/blob/main/census/census-2011.gif) [GIF]
3. [Displaying earthquakes in Europe from 2010-2022](https://nbviewer.org/github/szucshey/osm-data-exploration/blob/main/earthquakes/earthquakes.ipynb?flush_cache=true) [NBViewer]
4. Visualizing daily weather data in Hungary

    * [using Blender](https://github.com/szucshey/osm-data-exploration/blob/main/climate/results/gif_output_2.gif) [GIF]
5. [Map of urbex locations in Hungary](https://nbviewer.org/github/szucshey/osm-data-exploration/blob/main/urbex/urbex.ipynb) [NBViewer]

The notebooks can also be opened in Google Colab, and can be developed further by anyone. Every necessary data source can be found in the subfolders.

Detailed descriptions about each topic are in each subfolder's README.
